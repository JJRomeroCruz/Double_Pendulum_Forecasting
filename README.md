# Double Pendulum Forecasting

## 1. Short description

This project consists in a new method to forecast the trajectory of a dynamical system based in artificial neural networks. I try to use this method with a toy model: the double pendulum. 

## 2. Motivation

In this case the dynamical system is the known double pendulum, this system is really interesting since
it has a chaotic beheaviour so, although is a deterministic problem (it is posible to give a prediction
by using the differential equations giving some initial conditions), is very difficult because it exhibits a extremely different 
movement if we change a little bit the initial conditions. In the world of dynamical systems, the ones which exhibit a chaotic behaaviour are usually the most likely to 
be forecasted with other models like artificial networks.

The aim of this project, in a selfish point of view, is to learn more about dynamical systems treated like a time serie
